## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you have found a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

To report a vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, please report it via:

- **Email**: security@skigebiete-muenchen.de (or the maintainer's email)
- **GitHub**: Use the "Private vulnerability reporting" feature if enabled in Repository Settings > Security.

We will try to review your report as soon as possible and get back to you.
