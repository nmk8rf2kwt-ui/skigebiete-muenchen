## [1.7.7] - 2026-01-08

### 🩹 Bug Fixes
- **Radius Filter**: Fixed issue where the distance slider was not applied on initial load.
- **Performance**: Optimized radius filtering to happen purely client-side without triggering redundant API calls.

## [1.7.5] - 2026-01-08

### 🩹 Bug Fixes
- **Frontend Sorting**: Fixed a regression where sorting parameters (key, direction) were not passed to the rendering function, causing the table to reset on every click.
- **Mobile Layout**: Corrected misalignment in responsive card view where labels (e.g., "Distanz") were showing data from incorrect columns like "Schwierigkeit".

### 🧹 Refactoring
- **CSS Architecture**: Major cleanup of `style.css`. Introduced CSS variables for colors and spacing, consolidated media queries, and removed legacy/unused CSS classes.

- **Stability**: Fixed broken references to non-existent scripts and removed redundant CSV commit steps.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-01-07
- **Architecture**: Implemented a **Service Layer Pattern** with hierarchical folders (`weather/`, `resorts/`, `system/`) to improve separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Consolidation**: Reduced redundant and fragmented route files from 10 to 6, grouping related endpoints into unified controllers (e.g., Resorts + Lifts, Weather Forecast + Historical Weather).
- **Monitoring**: Unified system status, database health, and webcam monitoring into a single `system/monitoring.js` service.
- **Compatibility**: Preserved 100% backward compatibility for all API endpoints through a multi-router strategy in consolidated files.
- **Stability**: Refactored internal dependencies and updated the full test suite to align with the new directory structure.

- **Organization**: Refactored the monolithic `js/app.js` into a modular structure with dedicated files for event handling (`js/events.js`) and modal management (`js/modals.js`).
- **Readability**: Reduced `js/app.js` complexity significantly, focusing it on core data orchestration and state synchronization.
- **Maintainability**: Centralized event listeners and modal logic to simplify future feature additions and debugging.

## [1.6.6] - 2026-01-07
